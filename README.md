# Python-OpenCV2
OpenCV is the most widely used open source toolkit in computer vision, based on C/C, supports Linux/Windows/MacOS/Android/iOS, and provides interfaces in languages such as Python, Matlab, and Java. OpenCV released version 2.0 in 2010, adding a very complete C-plus interface, and the version from 2.0 is very user-savvy and is still being maintained and updated. OpenCV 3 was officially released in 2015, adding more algorithms, more performance optimization and a cleaner API, as well as enhanced GPU support, which has now been used in many research institutions and commercial companies. OpenCV3 offers more functionality and more convenience than OpenCV2. However, considering the compatibility with the deep learning framework, as well as the difficulty of installing, this part of the OpenCV2 is the main introduction.
